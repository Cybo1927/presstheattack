Filter list for ad blocking, tracking, mining, and more.

This project is under MIT license (see [License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bogachenko/presstheattack/master/LICENSE.md)) and it is creator — [Bogachenko Vyacheslav](https://github.com/bogachenko)

The overall goal of the project is to block ads and reduce traffic coming from the domains and websites you visit.
The term "advertising" in this project is not defined because, as I said above, apart from the obvious advertising, I also block banners and tooltips which I think create useless traffic without any real benefit.

My list is not limited to any region. Nevertheless, my personal attention is paid to english and russian regions, as I speak these languages.

## Denial of responsibility

I am not responsible for any damages that may arise from the use of these rules, including content that is hidden in error and interferes with the normal operation of the site.

You may find these rules to be overly zealous. Yes, I pay special attention to espionage, tracking and covert mining.
However, if you find that a rule violates a site, disable it using comments, and then create a [question](https://github.com/bogachenko/presstheattack/issues).

Please note that I mostly use uBlock Origin. I emphasize this because each browser and plugin is slightly different from each other. The uBlock Origin plugin works correctly with my list of filters, but I have not tested the functionality of my list with other plugins personally, so I admit that working with them may be incorrect

Despite this, I will do my best to maintain compatibility with Adblock Plus and other known plugins to block ads. However, you should understand that I can't regularly test my filter list with other plugins, so if you're having problems using Adblock Plus and similar plugins, feel free to raise this [issue](https://github.com/bogachenko/presstheattack/issues).
