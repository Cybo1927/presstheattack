Custom filters in this project allow you to block popular trackers, banners, upload and display ads on site pages and search results, and too this list also includes some cosmetic filters.

This project is the original, it is under the MIT license (see [License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bogachenko/presstheattack/master/LICENSE.md)) and created it [Bogachenko Vyacheslav](https://github.com/bogachenko)

The overall goal of the project is to block ads and reduce traffic coming from domains/websites that you visit.
The term "ads" is not defined in this project, because as I said above, besides the obvious ads, I also block cosmetic banners and tooltips, which, as I think, create useless traffic without any real benefit.

My list is not restricted by any region. However, my personal attention is English and Russian regions since I speak these languages.
